I am an applied economist working in Economic History, Development and Political Economy. I am currently a research fellow at **IAST - Toulouse School of Economics** and will join **King's College London as an Assistant Professor** (Department of Political Economy) in 2025.

My current projects explore the lasting consequences of violence during colonial slavery in the Caribbean, and gender-based violence in contemporary settings. I use state-of-the-art AI methods for document processing and understanding.
